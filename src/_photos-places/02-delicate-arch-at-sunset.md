description: "Delicate Arch is somewhat of a rite of passage for a landscape photographer. It represents what makes photography so rewarding and so frustrating. The Arch is perched at the edge of a natural sandstone ampitheatre framing the landscape behind it. It makes for wonderful photos, yet the beauty of the place can never truly be captured."
