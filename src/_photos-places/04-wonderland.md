Wonderland is a brand new public art piece in Calgary by the creator of the Crown Fountain in Chicago. It doesn't look real when you first look upon it. Its scale and detail make for interesting photographs. I decided to capture it at night where its contrast upon the scene was the greatest, and at a side view to highlight the contours of the face.
