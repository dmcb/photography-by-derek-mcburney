description: "If a photographer says otherwise, they are lying: photography involves a lot of luck. The Simmons Building is a gorgeous old building in Calgary's East Village. It was open for the public to take in for Doors Open YYC, and when I arrived, the sunlight was pouring in through the windows at a perfect angle."
