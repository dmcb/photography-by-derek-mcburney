description: "Fall has become my favourite time of the year, everything is so expressive! On a morning bike ride loop through Fish Creek park, I was taking note of the most striking areas to shoot for the return. The light, colour and seemingly endless forest looked every bit as good on the camera as I had hoped on my ride."
