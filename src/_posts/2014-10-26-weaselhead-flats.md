I'd been making bike trips to the Weaselhead Flats over summer and into the beautiful fall, and just had to bring my camera along one time. This area is an absolute gem in Calgary.

While I myself am opposed to the southwest leg of the ring road that will impact this area, I understand for some Calgarians the need for such a road. Let's make sure the Alberta government builds the road through Weaselhead with the upmost respect for its surroundings.
