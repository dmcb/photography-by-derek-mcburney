  6: I love the colours!
  7: They always say if you think you're close, get closer, to take a good photograph. I might overdo this, but I love it. The viewer is right there with the family in this great moment in time.
  8: I love the kinetic energy of this photo. At first when I looked through the zillions of photos I had of Ryden, I thought this one might be a dud because I didn't catch all of his face. But that's actually one of the reasons I love this photo. We're so in the moment with Ryden we can hardly keep up! This photo also demonstrates why I love prime lenses. With a zoom, I most assuredly would have had Ryden entirely within the frame and the photo would have been half as interesting.

description: "To keep up with Ryden, I had to take a ton of photos. He made me work hard this day, but it was a blast! I tried to think of the day from Ryden's perspective for this shoot, and I loved watching him interact with ducks, leaves and of course his parents in this beautiful Fall scene."
