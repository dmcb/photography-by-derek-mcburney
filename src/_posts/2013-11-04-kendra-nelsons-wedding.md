I felt very privileged to be able to shoot Kendra and Nelson's wedding. They're both friends of mine, and I always love to mention that they met on my soccer team! Their wedding was a wonderful day, and despite knowing them for years, I've never seen them so happy, or their smiles so big as they were this day (which makes my job easy!)
