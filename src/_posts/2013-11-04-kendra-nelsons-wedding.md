  7: Alright boys, let's do this!
  10: This is the biggest smile I've ever seen on Kendra!
  14: I found this mural ahead of time, and knew the wedding party was going to be colourful, so it was the perfect match.
  17: I love Nelson's presence in this photo. Even though the focus is clearly on Kendra (and her eyes), Nelsons broad stance makes it clear, this shot is about Kendra being his wife.
  22: I wanted to make sure the shoot with the wedding party was quick and felt like a celebration, not work! This photo was even more fun to make than to look at.
  24: So HAPPY!
  27: I went ultra-wide on this shot to surround Kendra and Nelson with as many of their guests as possible.

I felt very privileged to be able to shoot Kendra and Nelson's wedding. They're both friends of mine, and I always love to mention that they met on my soccer team! Their wedding was a wonderful day, and despite knowing them for years, I've never seen them so happy, or their smiles so big as they were this day (which makes my job easy!)
