  4: If I had a nickel for number of weddings I've shot where the groomsmen wait to get dressed until the end only to struggle at dressing themselves!
  10: It was hot, but beautifully sunny for the ceremony.
  13: I've been to many weddings at golf courses, but we don't usually hit the links. Racing after the newlyweds in a golf cart to grab this shot was satisfying.
  14: A very somber moment for Katie and Graeme - they visited a grove dedicated to Katie's father who had passed away, and Graeme had also lost his father. I had to be respectful of the moment.

Being able to attend many weddings as a photographer, it's interesting to see how each wedding is similar and yet so different. Katie and Graeme's wedding took place at the Earl Grey Golf Club, the same venue where Katie's maid of honour Anna had her wedding. So while the backdrop may be similar, capturing how everything unfolds can be quite a different process.
