I always consider it an absolute privilege to be able to photograph a wedding and share such and important story from my perspective. But Sugand and Christoph's took this privilege to another level, as it was an incredibly intimate affair with only a dozen family members as guests.

Instead of having to snipe photos from 50 feet away, I was right in the ceremony to capture that intimacy. To be able to spend so much time with the couple and their guests so closely over the course of a beautiful day was a dream as a photographer, and I hope the photos here reflect that.
