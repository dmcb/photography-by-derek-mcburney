When Adam and Mary told me they were having their wedding at the Rimrock Hotel in Banff, I knew it was going to be beautiful. All I had to do for great shots was account for the changing light conditions as the couple was lucky enough to have the clouds turn to bright blue sky just in time for the ceremony.
