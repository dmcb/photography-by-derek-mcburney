I prepared for Marnie and Jeff's engagement shoot by scouting our meeting location for light and texture I could take advantage of. The rustic walls of the old Dominion Bank building caught my eye. The light cast was being filtered through nearby trees and I knew it would result in a playful light to bring them into a brilliant focus.
