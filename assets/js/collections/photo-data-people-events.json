	"description": "My fiance Hailey would be the first to say that I never listen, and she'd be right. I distinctly recall her here telling me she didn't want me to shoot a photo in this moment, but in my defence, she couldn't see what I saw. The vivid colours and contrast of light and shadow highlights the intimacy of this personal moment. She forgave my indiscretion when she saw the photo."

	"description": "Nuit Blanche, a late night public art display in downtown, hit Calgary for the first time this year and it was a blast. One of the installations was a cloud of light bulbs that people could turn on and off. It was a dazzling display that many onlookers were absorbed by and I tried to capture that story through my shots."
