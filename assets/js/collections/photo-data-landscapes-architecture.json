	"description": "Fall has become my favourite time of the year, everything is so expressive! On a morning bike ride loop through Fish Creek park, I was taking note of the most striking areas to shoot for the return. The light, colour and seemingly endless forest looked every bit as good on the camera as I had hoped on my ride."

	"description": "If a photographer says otherwise, they are lying: photography involves a lot of luck. The Simmons Building is a gorgeous old building in Calgary's East Village. It was open for the public to take in for Doors Open YYC, and when I arrived, the sunlight was pouring in through the windows at a perfect angle."
