	"description": "I prepared for Marnie and Jeff's engagement shoot by scouting our meeting location for light and texture I could take advantage of. The rustic walls of the old Dominion Bank building caught my eye. The light cast was being filtered through nearby trees and I knew it would result in a playful light to bring them into a brilliant focus.",

	"description": "My fiance Hailey would be the first to say that I never listen, and she'd be right. I distinctly recall her here telling me she didn't want me to shoot a photo in this moment, but in my defence, she couldn't see what I saw. The vivid colours and contrast of light and shadow highlights the intimacy of this personal moment. She forgave my indiscretion when she saw the photo.",
