	"description": "I prepared for Marnie and Jeff's engagement shoot by scouting our meeting location for light and texture I could take advantage of. The rustic walls of the old Dominion Bank building caught my eye. The light cast was being filtered through nearby trees and I knew it would result in a playful light to bring them into a brilliant focus."

All I had to do for great shots was account for the changing light conditions as the couple was lucky enough to have the clouds turn to bright blue sky just in time for the ceremony."
