				My fiance Hailey would be the first to say that I never listen, and she'd be right. I distinctly recall her here telling me she didn't want me to shoot a photo in this moment, but in my defence, she couldn't see what I saw. The vivid colours and contrast of light and shadow highlights the intimacy of this personal moment. She forgave my indiscretion when she saw the photo.

				Photography is a passion of mine - I constantly seek new moments to capture and challenges to undertake. I love life and try my absolute hardest to take none of it for granted. There is beauty everywhere and I'm fortunate enough to be able to share it from my perspective.
