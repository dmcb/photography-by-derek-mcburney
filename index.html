					<h2>Candle Lighting</h2>
					<p>
						My fiance Hailey would be the first to say that I never listen, and she'd be right. I distinctly recall her here telling me she didn't want me to shoot a photo in this moment, but in my defence, she couldn't see what I saw. The vivid colours and contrast of light and shadow highlights the intimacy of this personal moment. She forgave my indiscretion when she saw the photo.

				<h2>Marnie and Jeff with the Old Dominion Bank</h2>
				<p>
					I prepared for Marnie and Jeff's engagement shoot by scouting our meeting location for light and texture I could take advantage of. The rustic walls of the old Dominion Bank building caught my eye. The light cast was being filtered through nearby trees and I knew it would result in a playful light to bring them into a brilliant focus.

						Photography is a passion of mine - I constantly seek new moments to capture and challenges to undertake. There is beauty everywhere and I'm fortunate enough to be able to share it from my perspective. I would be humbled to help tell your story.
